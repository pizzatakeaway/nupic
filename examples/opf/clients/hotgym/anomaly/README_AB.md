The script `hotgym_anomaly.py`, outputs in the terminal the **timestamp** and the **anomaly score** at which an anomaly has been detected (at least the firsts). Furthermore, all the **timestamp** and the **anomaly score** are stored in `anomaly_scores.csv`.
Here is also where the **ANOMALY THRESHOLD** option is set.
